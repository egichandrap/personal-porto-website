        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I&apos;m a backend engineer specializing in Java and Go, with over 4 years of experience building scalable, resilient, and high-performance systems. I care deeply about clean architecture, efficient microservices, and delivering backend solutions that drive impactful digital products.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Since starting my professional journey in 2020, I&apos;ve contributed to national-scale products across the telecom, fintech, and gov-tech sectorsâ€”helping teams ship robust backend services for features like emergency credit, quota injection, and digital payment integrations.
        I take pride in understanding both the technical and business sides of software developmentâ€”translating complex logic into maintainable code while aligning with product goals and user impact. I&apos;m a proactive problem-solver who enjoys collaborating within squads and shipping meaningful features.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-base sm:text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies and architectural patterns, staying updated with backend engineering trends, and occasionally mentoring or supporting junior devs. I&apos;m always excited to work on challenging projects that push the boundaries of backend innovation.
        </p>
